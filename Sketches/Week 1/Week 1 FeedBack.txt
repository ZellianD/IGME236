mug on the left looks cooler and intentially designed and the other looks more to be mass produced 
circle handles are really hard to hold
left mug tea infuser is a huge plus 
rather be gifted the mug on the left 
left is more accessible right is not accessible
right could burn hand 
wide open allows for more hands to go in 
handle is pretty sturdy 
(general note: hand writing small)
